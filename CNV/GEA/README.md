# Perform GEA analysis of CNVs

----
This program performs genotype-environment association analysis on detected copy number variations (CNVs).

## Steps
0. Core method: BayeScEnv;
1. Prepare input files:
    * Environmental data: environmental information in the form of ‘environmental differentiation’, which is usually computed as a contrast to a reference (usually the average environment, but not obligatory), and as a distance. For each environmental variable, the input is one line that has each column as the distance of each sample (cautious about the order!). 
    * Genotype data: generated by converting population CNV frequency (generated from the CNV pipeline) to counts based on X- or Autosome-wide median effective sample size (from SNP analzyed sites).

## Notes
1. The environmental data is inherited from the same files used for GEA analysis of SNPs.
2. Quality check of estimation of CNV allele frequency is made by estimating genome-wide Fst (Reynolds, weighted average across CNVs).
